## Description

On September 2022 multiple security vulnerabilities were found in some webshop. One vulnerability gave
attackers access to crm data of all customers during the last 2 and a half year. Exploitation of those
data include:
* Leak personal data (name, address) related customers and a potential GDPR nightmare
* Potentially find prices and reduction applied to big or professional customers
   
   
## Communication

Communication with e-shop IT team has proved difficult. In the end, having identified an IT security
responsible party on LinkedIn, contact was made using the "request quote" form.

Third party said they are aware of issue and are fixing it. They did not accept to receive the analysis. Well, I can't force them.
