This is a dump area for various document or personal stuff I work on.

I might put some stories here from time to time. Or I may not. I will add 
more security findings in the future if I'm part of new Responsible Disclosures.

Currently the only interesting page is an explanation of [some spring vulnerability](/security/findings/spring-stomp-dos/).
